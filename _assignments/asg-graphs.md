#### Assignment: Graphs

**Submission Deadline: Thursday, November 21, 2024, at 19**

This lab has two independent parts based on `asg-graphs/graphs.py` and `asg-graphs/wiener.py`.



Number of point to be achieved in `graphs.py` : 100
Number of point to be achieved in `wiener.py` :   4




The points from `wiener.py` do not count on the
final score, they are kept apart and will help in making final decisions
in case of doubts between grades.
However, I would suggest not to make tight calculations about the grade and rather to solve and learn as much as you can.
