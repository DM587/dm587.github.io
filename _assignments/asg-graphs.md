#### Assignment: Graphs

**Submission Deadline: Thursday, November 21, 2024, at 19**

This lab has two independent parts based on `asg-graphs/graphs.py` and `asg-graphs/wiener.py`.



- Number of points to be achieved in `graphs.py` : 100

- Number of points to be achieved in `wiener.py` :   4



The points from wiener.py do not count in the final score, they are kept apart and will help in making final decisions in case of doubts between grades. As always, I reccomend not making tight calculations about the grade and rather solving and learning as much as possible.
