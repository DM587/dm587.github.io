#### Assignment: From Random Polygon to Ellipse / Wiener Index 

*Submission Deadline: Thursday, December 30, 2023, at noon*


The scripts in your git repository that you have to edit and submit before the deadline are
`asg-wienerpolygon/wiener.py` and
`asg-wienerpolygon/polygon.py`.  
You get the two files and the file for visualizing the polygon by pulling your git repository.
